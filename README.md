# Cloud Project

This is my public repo for my two cloud project done in my ITMO: Cloud Computing Technologies class in Illinois Tech. You have the choice of either a Three_Tier cloud native application or a simple web application both made with Amazon Web Service. You need to follow the Readmes in both project to make them work.
